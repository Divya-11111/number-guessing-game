# Guessing The Number

## Description
"Guessing The Number" is a fun and simple smart contract game built on Ethereum. In this game, players will guess a number between 1 and 100. If they guess the correct number, they win the prize!

The smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum network, and players need to send the correct prize amount to participate. If the guess is correct, the player wins all Ether accumulated in the contract.

## Smart Contract Address
The deployed contract address is:  
**0xC599aD0C3C4C421C194196c9950a49112c8820f5**

## How to Play
1. Send exactly 1 Ether to the contract address.
2. Guess a number between 1 and 100.
3. If your guess is correct, you win the prize (all Ether in the contract).
4. The game will automatically stop once someone wins.

## Features
- Players guess a number to win a prize.
- The contract owner can start and end the game.
- The prize is transferred to the winner upon a correct guess.
- All game actions are handled through Ethereum smart contract transactions.

## Requirements
- An Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the contract.
- At least 1 Ether to participate in the game.
